    Form for instrument using a dll for communication.

    Attributes
    ----------
    lib_path : unicode
        Path to the library.

    instr_id : str
        Id used to access to the instrument using the library.

    Methods
    -------
    check()
        Check whether or not enough information have been given by the user.
        Called when the user attempt to press the ok button of the form he is
        editing.

    required_fields()
        Return a string listing the field that the user must fill. Called when
        the check method fail.

    connection_dict()
        Return a dictionnary holding all the necessary informations to open a
        connection with an instrument using the protocol for which the form was
